    Hi! I'm Marcus Baw. I'm a locum GP in the North West, with a fairly unusual portfolio career in Health IT, health hacking, Open Source and some other cool stuff. I also founded and run <a href="http://www.leighhack.org/">Leigh Hackspace</a> and am a self-taught Ruby developer of sorts.
  </p>

  <h2>Health IT</h2>
  <p>
    My Health IT CV is on this site, I've been lucky enough to work in many areas of Health IT and Health Informatics, both in small agile setups and within huge lumbering organisations. I can advise on: medical user requirements · getting clinical engagement · improving documentation · troubleshooting · clinical knowledge management · medical UI/UX design · iterative development · agile working · platform advice · ‘million-pound-chair’ detection · clinical safety · open sourcing your product.
  </p>

  <h2>Discourse</h2>
  <p>
    Through my work running the <a href="http://www.digitalhealth.net/">Digital Health Networks</a> CCIO, CIO and HSCIC Digital Leaders <a href="https://discourse.digitalhealth.net/">forum</a> and the <a href="http://forum.ehealthireland.ie/">eHealth Ireland</a> forum, all of which are based on the awesome open source forum platform <a href="www.discourse.org">Discourse</a>, I've become pretty adept at setting up secure, UK-hosted Discourse forums, and in how to build and maintain your vibrant community using a forum. <a href="">Contact me</a> if your organisation or community needs a Discourse forum.
  </p>

  <h2>Nonprofits</h2>
  <p>
    In 2012 I co-founded (with Rob Dyke and Ewan Davis) [openhealthhub.org](http://www.openhealthhub.org), which was originally called OpenGPSoC, and is a non-profit organisation dedicated to open governance, open source code, and open standards in Health IT. Nowadays it also provides the <strong>missing open forum</strong> in Health IT. There is a lot of online discussion going on in Health IT, but too much of it is within closed organisations, in closed fora, or otherwise Not On The Open Internet. openhealthhub.org is different it's public, free, open and always will be. Join [here](http://www.openhealthhub.org)

  <h2>WiFi</h2>
  <p>
    I ran some surveys of WiFi access for NHS Staff in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and highlighted the issue of poor WiFi access for frontline NHS Staff. More recently I am involved in trying to popularise the idea of an Eduroam-like WiFi roaming system across all public sector organisations.

  <h2>GP / Emergency Medicine</h2>
  <p>
    Feel free to check out my Medical CV and call me if you need a locum GP, although my availability is <strong>very</strong> limited these days...
  </p>

  <h2>Supporting Open Source</h2>
  <p>
    Our company Baw Medical supports open source with more than just good thoughts and talk – we support with real actual money too – we donate to open source projects we rate highly or have used in our work. Recent donations: LimeSurvey, PortableApps Platform, Wikipedia, Mozilla, AntennaPod.
