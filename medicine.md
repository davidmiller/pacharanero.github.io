## MANAGEMENT & CLINICAL GOVERNANCE
During my time as a trainee in a range of hospital specialities and later in Primary Care, I have gradually developed a strong interest in management, and in particular in the style of implementation employed when aiming to make organisational changes. I have always maintained that ease of use and practicality in new systems are the key to harmonious adoption of a new system. Put simply:

> “make it easier to do it right than do it wrong, and people will probably do it right.”

Unfortunately this simple principle is often ignored and that is why we see cumbersome, clunky, unfit-for-purpose, committee-designed computer systems being rolled out by a distant hierarchy, to a staff who rapidly find themselves mired in extra work. By and large, people are not inherently opposed to new technology, when it is designed well, and it helps them. Many people happily use email and Facebook at home but hate the computer system at work.

Below are some examples of my previous work in the area of safety, clinical governance, management and implementation style.

* **Changes to Documents Scanning Procedure: (2013, A Secure Environment)** Upon arrival at the secure environment a summary of medical record is requested from the patient’s usual GP – usually this arrives within 48hrs, however due to delays in GP processing of the faxes, the information would often not be available for clinical use for up to 4 weeks. I was instrumental in resolving this issue in order to provide a system that allowed the documents to be available on our EHR immediately on arrival, and for checking of the faxes to be done electronically, with the advantage that it could be done from any terminal in the healthcare unit, and as a result the checking process could be parallelized and done faster.

* **‘A-Z Referral Map’: February 2010 – ongoing.** In response to my own organisational needs I began to collect electronic and scanned referral forms, and referral pathway information, when I started working in General Practice. Initially this was because I knew what service I wanted to refer to, but not how to do it. Over time the document became larger and attracted the interest of other doctors, since it gradually came to form a digital repository of all relevant referral information, including scanned or electronic forms of the referral documents/forms. This not only streamlined and sped up the process of referral, but also obviated the need for keeping a store of paper referral forms in the practice, since all forms can now simply be printed on demand. I await the day that the need for all this would be obviated by Choose & Book (now rebranded e-RS:‘e-Referral System’ – 2013)

* **‘Wigan Paediatrics Guidelines for iPhone’ Project:** December 2009 – February 2010

* **Pocket O&G Drug Guide:** May 2009

* **Emergency Floor Doctors’ Guide:** November 2008

* **Wigan RAEI SMR (Standardised Mortality Rate) Taskforce:** 2008 – 2009

## AUDIT

I am an advocate of the use of good clinical audit to support systems change and improvement. Some of my recent audits include:

* QOF QP1-5 criteria, rapid audit to challenge quality of the PCT’s data, June 2011
* Osteoporosis treatment and prescribing, Seven Brooks Medical Centre, 2011
* Fumaderm® in Psoriasis: July 2010 (Proposer: Dr D Ramlogan, Cons Derm)
* Paediatric Ward Neonatal Admissions: January 2010 (Proposer: Dr V Sharma, Cons NNU/Paeds)
* Hyperemesis Gravidarum: March 2009 (Proposer: Dr C McGettigan, SpR O&G)

## PUBLICATIONS and PRESS

* ‘Turning doctors into coders’, BMJ feature 2013 by Jon Hoeksma, the editor of eHealth Insider for which I was interviewed.

* RCGP ‘Patient Online‘ Roadmap document (I was a principal author of the Defining The Offering section)

* ‘Open source GP project takes off’, eHealth Insider, 18 October 2012 – Interview about openGPSoC.
* BMJ Rapid responses, 19th May 2005 – Letter to Editor about severely flawed reporting in the BMJ of the findings of the NCEPOD report ‘An Acute Problem’.

* Journal of the Intensive Care Society, June 2004 – Letter to Editor refuting some assertions made regarding the format of JICS.

## MEDICAL INTERESTS

* Digital Health – including maximising use of free and open source software, development of robust and efficient web-based clinician tools, speech recognition, and use of hand-held devices such as smartphones in decision support.

* Dermatology – During my GP VTS Training I completed a 6 months Dermatology post which allowed me to gain valuable knowledge in the recognition and management of most common skin conditions. I remain a member of the Primary Care Dermatology Society, which allows me to access their CPD resources, meetings, conferences and publications.

* Pain Management – with previous experience including 5 years in Anaesthesia, I have additional skills in the assessment and management of pain conditions including acute and chronic pains, pain syndromes, some injection techniques, and improved understanding of and liaison with the available secondary care/referral pain services.

* Emergency Medicine – this is an area of medicine I spent a long time practicing in prior to becoming a GP, and I continue to do regular work in this area, which maintains my knowledge and skills in the acute environment, and also complements and enhances my primary care skills.

## HOBBIES AND INTERESTS
I am married and have two children. We live on and ‘hobby-farm’ a one-acre smallholding and enjoy growing fruit and vegetables and breeding ducks and hens. I follow realistic sustainable and organic principles and strongly support recycling, bio-fuels, and Permaculture. I also like all kinds of traditional manual crafts and primitive skills such as brewing, candle making, woodwork and wood boat building, cooking and preserving, and I am a member of the International Guild of Knot Tyers.

I am an avid musician and have been playing guitar in bands and musical productions for 17 years. I have a widely varied taste in music encompassing jazz, swing and folk, and regularly play in informal acoustic sessions.

I also enjoy outdoor hobbies such as canoeing, hill walking, mountain biking, and photography. I am a voluntary helper with local Scouts and teach Bushcraft and Knotwork to the scouts.

I am a fluent computer user and have been into computing since my parents bought me and my brother our first computer (an Acorn Electron) in about 1983. I am an experienced advanced user of Windows XP and 7, and a few years ago began to use Linux as my main operating system. I currently mainly use Ruby, Ruby on Rails, HTML/CSS/JS, as well as the Windows automation language AutoHotKey, and the similar framework for Linux AutoKey. OS-wise I currently use Linux Mint 17.3 Cinnamon.
