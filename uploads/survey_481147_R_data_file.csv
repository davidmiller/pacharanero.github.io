It would also be extremely beneficial for staff to be able to have easy access to communicate between hospital, community, hospices and other care organisations. WiFi would make this communication more streamlined but does require each organisation to allow open access to their systems. I work for a hospice but provide a service to an acute hospital and the two IT systems do not link together thus time is spent inputting into both organisation's data systems. This involves me having to move from the ward over to the hospice to get access to their IT system which in fact does have WiFi.For patients and families I think WiFi access would be very helpful in particular so they can keep in touch with family and friends or make any arrangements  they need to."

There is virtually no useable mobile network signal in the hospital and so those without the Blackberry devices are essentially incommunicado while at work. This requires them to either leave the workplace to do essential email and phone activity or use Trust phones for personal calls (officially forbidden). Alternatively this must all be done before work (when nobody is in the office to be called) or after work (likewise).
