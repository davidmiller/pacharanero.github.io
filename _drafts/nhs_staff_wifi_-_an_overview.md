I've collected together some information about my work over several years on **WiFi in the NHS**

## NHS WiFi Programme

* I'm currently Chair of the NHS Digital WiFi Programme Advisory Group, which is advising on the introduction of pan-NHS free WiFi for staff and patients. Below are some resources explaining more about the Programme, which is in Domain A of the NIB Workstreams.

## NHS WiFi Survey (unofficial)

For 3 consecutive years (2013, 2014, 2015) I ran an NHS WiFi Survey, asking clinicians and other staff in directly patient-facing roles what their experience of WiFi access was in their place of work. This work was done following a conversation on the NHS Hack Day mailing list, in which there was a difference of opinion about what level of WiFi availability there was in the NHS, and we found that there was no existing data about this. So we created a survey to help answer the question.

The [TL;DR](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Wikipedia:Too_long;_didn%27t_read) is: **In 2013 about 22% of NHS staff who responded to my survey had access to free WiFi. By 2015 this was getting to around 50%. These figures are now probably out of date, but they are actually the only data available on Staff WiFi in the NHS!**

## 2013

* [Discussion about the survey](https://www.networks.nhs.uk/discussion/a-lifeboat-for-nhs-managers/33103965) on NHS Networks

## 2014
* Detailed information on the [2014 NHS WiFi Survey](http://www.bawmedical.co.uk/t/september-2014-2nd-national-nhs-wifi-survey/32)
* My presentation about the survey in the Skunkworks at EHI Live 2014

## 2015
* The 2015 survey got somewhat swamped by some of my other work - another survey - this time the [Clinical Software Usability Survey](http://usability.digitalhealth.net/). Hence the numbers for the 2015 WiFi Survey were tiny, and probably didn't add much to the existing data. You should probably ignore them. I did a new presentation at EHI Live 2015 with a [summary of the 2013-2015 findings]({{ site.url }}/nhswifi2015/#/)
