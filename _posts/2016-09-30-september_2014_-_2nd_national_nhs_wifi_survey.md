Following the [2013 WiFi Survey](/may-2013-national-nhs-wifi-survey/), I ran a repeat survey in 2014, to see if there had been any change in the provision of WiFi to clinical NHS staff in the intervening year.

In short, there had been a significant **increase** in availability of WiFi to NHS staff at their place of NHS work, from around 25% in 2013 to 50% in 2014.
