**RCGP Patient Online**Â As part of my work with the RCGP Health Informatics Group (HIG) I was heavily involved in developing the conceptual approach to the Royal College of GP&#8217;s &#8220;Patient Online&#8221; Roadmap document and wrote significant portions of the &#8220;Defining the Offering&#8221; section for which I was credited as a significant author in the document&#8217;s introduction. We were tasked to develop an approach that would fulfil the Prime Ministerial mandate [that all patients should be able to access their records online by 2015] while ensuring that Information Governance principles were not violated and that the needs and concerns of patients and the medical profession were duly taken into account. The Roadmap now being complete and having received sign-off from College Council, we will be moving into the implementation stage through 2013-2014.
