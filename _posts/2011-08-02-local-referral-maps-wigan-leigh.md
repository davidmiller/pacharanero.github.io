**Local Referral Maps** While working in the Ashton, Leigh and Wigan PCT/CCG area as a GP trainee in 2010, I developed an electronic repository of referral guidance and referral forms, pertinent to the local area. This kind of information con be quite hard to find, and different practices store this information in numerous different ways. Some are quite organised and have the referral forms automagically mail merged with patient details and printed on demand from their clinical system, but rarely is it comprehensive and there is no facility to record &#8220;referrals guidance&#8221; information alongside this. Many practices simply have a huge tattered folder full of photocopies of referral forms somewhere in the office. I decided first to scan any referral forms I encountered, and then provide them from an electronic repository (HTML page). The digital forms and the container page were distributed using Dropbox to the practices that liked the idea of the repository and asked to be on the distribution list. After finishing my GP training I was unable his project for a while and it was not maintained. However, I do plan to revive the project, perhaps reformatting it to function as a Wiki which would allow collaborative editing and maintenance.
