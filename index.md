Hi! I'm Marcus Baw. I'm a locum GP in the North West, with a fairly unusual portfolio career in Health IT, health hacking, Open Source and some other cool stuff. I also founded and run [Leigh Hackspace](http://www.leighhack.org/) and am a self-taught Ruby & Rails developer.

## Health IT

I've been lucky enough to work in many areas of Health IT and Health Informatics, both in small agile setups and within large organisations. I can advise on: real-world medical user needs · getting clinical engagement · improving documentation · troubleshooting · clinical knowledge management · medical UI/UX design · iterative development · agile working · platform consultancy · ‘million-pound-chair’ detection · clinical safety · open sourcing your product. [Contact me here](mailto:marcusbaw@gmail.com)

## Discourse

Through my work running [openhealthhub.org](http://www.openhealthhub.org), the [Digital Health Networks](https://discourse.digitalhealth.net/) forum for the Chief Clinical Information Officers (CCIO) Network, the Health CIO Network, the HSCIC Digital Leaders network, and the [eHealth Ireland](http://www.ehealthireland.ie) network, all of which are [Discourse]() forums, I've become pretty adept at setting up **secure**, **UK-hosted** Discourse forums, and in building and maintaining an active clinical community using web forums.  [Contact me](mailto:marcusbaw@gmail.com) if your organisation or community needs a Discourse forum.

## Nonprofits

In 2012 I co-founded (with Rob Dyke and Ewan Davis) [openhealthhub.org](http://www.openhealthhub.org), which was originally called OpenGPSoC, and is a non-profit organisation dedicated to open governance, open source code, and open standards in Health IT. Nowadays it also provides the <strong>missing open forum</strong> in Health IT. There is a lot of online discussion going on in Health IT, but too much of it is within closed organisations, in closed fora, or otherwise Not On The Open Internet. Openhealthhub.org is different: it's public, free, open and always will be. Join [here](http://www.openhealthhub.org)

## WiFi in the NHS
I ran some surveys of WiFi access for NHS Staff in 2013, 2014 and 2015, and highlighted the issue of poor WiFi access for frontline NHS Staff. More recently I am involved in trying to popularise the idea of an Eduroam-like WiFi roaming system across all public sector organisations.

## GP / Emergency Medicine
Feel free to check out my Medical CV and call me if you need a locum GP, although my availability is **very** limited these days...

## Supporting Open Source
Our company Baw Medical supports open source with more than just nice warm thoughts and talk – we support with real actual money too – we donate to open source projects we rate highly or have used in our work. Recent donations: LimeSurvey, PortableApps Platform, Wikipedia, Mozilla, AntennaPod.
